- **Spectroscopic Data Processing**
  - Be_grism_proc_auto_JRM_new.ipynb
    - This is the main processing notebook for the spectroscopic data. It takes a 2D 
    spectrum image, extracts a 1D spectrum, applies wavelength calibration, applies 
    flux/gain calibration. It is also capable of deriving these solutions when needed and 
    updating the .pkl files.
  - grism_utils_v2.py
    - This contains the class structure and various functionalities for processing spectra
    including fitting the spectral trace, extracting the 1D spectrum, deriving wavelength
    + gain calibration from standard stars, and applying wavelength + gain calibration to 
    science spectra
  - STELIB, ESO, CALSPEC
    - These folders contain reference spectra for spectrophotometric standard stars used in
    the calibration derivation procedure.
  - .pkl files
    - These contain historic wavelength and gain solutions already derived such that they do
    not need to be rederived each time. The ZWO files are for the previous backend + camera 
    while the QHY files are for the current backend + camera (as of 2026/05/06).
  - Grism_Calib_Testing_{camera}_{filter}.ipynb
    - These notebooks are for deriving the wavelength and gain calibration in case the 
    procedure needs to be updated and calibration needs to be rederived for historic data. 
    There are four files for each camera (ZWO + QHY) and each filter (lrg + hrg).
  - Wave_Calib_{source name}_{filter}.ipynb
    - These notebooks are for inspecting individual calibrator sources to determine optimal
    features to use as points in the wavelength solution derivation and optimal regions to 
    mask for the gain curve solution derivation.
  - Grism_Focus_Optimizer.ipynb
    - This notebook contains a procedure for determining the optimal focus position for both
    the lrg and hrg. This requires a dataset of lrg and hrg images with varying focal 
    positions and broadband images taken after an autofocus routine to determine the focus 
    offsets of the lrg and hrg relative to the broadband images.
  - RLMT_stack_to_BeSS.ipynb
    - This notebook stacks all of the spectra for a given day and reformats the header to 
    include BeSS-specific keywords for submitting our spectra to BeSS to provide to the 
    wider scientific community! How about that! 

- **Spectroscopic Data Analysis**
  - Be_Spectral_Analysis_Master_Local.ipynb
    - This notebook is able to fit to various forms that spectral lines can take including
    absorption, double absorption, single-peaked emission, and double-peaked emission. It 
    tracks the amplitudes, centroids, fwhms, equivalent widths, and V/R (if applicable) over
    time. It can also fit a spectroscopic keplerian rv curve for centroids of binary 
    systems.
    - fit_utils.py
      - This contains various functions supporting Be_Spectral_Analysis_Master_Local.ipynb
  - Simplified_Spectral_Analysis.ipynb
    - This notebook is pretty much the same as Be_Spectral_Analysis_Master_Local.ipynb 
    except that you are able to specify any number of voigt profile components each with 
    their own heights, centroids, and variability tolerances when fitted in time series.
    - simplifited_fit_utils.py
      - Same as fit_utils.py but for this one
  - Model_Spectra_Fitting.ipynb
    - As a preface, this notebook requires the actual library of model spectra. If desired, 
    contact me for access.
    - This notebook takes a grid of model spectra for a Be star + disk and performs a 
    figure of merit minimization algorithm to find the best fitting synthetic spectra to 
    observations, where each model spectra is associated with a configuration of system 
    parameters (stellar mass, disk radius, inclination angle, base density, power-law 
    index). Contains histogram representations of results under a certain figure of merit 
    threshold as opposed to a single best-fit value
    - Can also run this in parallel for time-series analyses of any number of 
    spectra and is compatible with both BeSS data (variable R) and RLMT grism data  
    (relatively constant R). Contains heat map visualizations of time-series analysis 
    results (basically just histograms with a time dimension).
    - Also contains a 3D model function for visualization of the Be star + disk system.
    - model_spectra_utils.py
      - Contains various functions supporting Model_Spectra_Fitting.ipynb

    + gain solutions and model spectral fitting.
